                            Don't believe what you hear
    Don't believe what you see
    If you just close your eyes
    You can feel the enemy
    When I first met you girl
    You had fire in your soul
    What happened your face of melting in snow?
    Now it looks like this
    And you can swallow
    Or you can spit
    You can throw it up
    Or choke on it
    And you can dream
    So dream out loud
    You know that your time is coming 'round
    So don't let the bastards grind you down
    No, nothing makes sense
    Nothing seems to fit
    I know you'd hit out
    If you only knew who to hit
    And I'd join the movement
    If there was one I could believe in
    Yeah I'd break bread and wine
    If there was a church I could receive in
    'Cause I need it now
    To take the cup
    To fill it up
    To drink it slow
    I can't let you go
    I must be an acrobat
    To talk like this
    And act like that
    And you can dream
    So dream out loud
    And don't let the bastards grind you down
    Oh, it hurts baby
    What are we going to do? Now it's all been said
    No new ideas in the house and every book has been read
    And I must be an acrobat
    To talk like this
    And act like that
    And you can dream
    So dream out loud
    And you can find
    Your own way out
    And you can build
    And I can will
    And you can call
    I can't wait until
    You can stash
    And you can seize
    Responsibilities
    And I can love
    And I can love</p>
